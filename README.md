# SDRAM Controller <img align="right" width="220" height="200" src="micron_sdram.png">

This repository contains a Micron 128Mb (**MT48LC4M32B2**) SDRAM controller written in VHDL. This is a relative small device (16MByte) which you may find on some old FPGA development boards. I wrote the code back in 2007 and although the design is somewhat outdated somebody might still find some use for it. 

I have made some minor VHDL2008 changes and checked it against a modern Modelsim version.

The processor side to the SDRAM controller is a basic SRAM interface modeled on a 8086/186 processor (*see procedures wrmem/rdmem in sdram_ctrl_tester.vhd*). A typical 8086/186 memory cycle starts by asserting the **ALE** (Address Latch Enable) signal which indicates the address is valid and can be latched followed by an active low **RDN** or active low write **WRN** strobe. The cycle is terminated with the **READY** signal is asserted.

The SDRAM [**MT48LC4M32B2**](https://www.micron.com/products/dram/sdram/part-catalog/mt48lc4m32b2b5-6a) memory model is provided by Micron. Note this is (as usual) a Verilog behavioral model and hence you need a mixed language simulator.

The testbench executes 3 tests:
1) A read/write test to the same row
2) A read/write test to a different bank/row
3) A random read/write pattern test

If no errors are detected a **test passed** messages is returned.

## Requirements
1) Dual language Modelsim/Questa or any other mixed language simulator will do.

## Check before building
1) Make sure the Modelsim/Questa win64pe/win64 directory is in your search path.

## Simulation

To run the simulation under Windows simple execute the **run.bat** file in a CMD prompt.

The output should be something like:

```
E:\SDRAM-Controller>run.bat
Check if work library exists
Compile VHDL SDRAM Controller
Compile Micron Verilog Memory model
Compile VHDL testbench
